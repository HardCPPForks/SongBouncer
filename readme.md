Initially created to handle song _suggestions_ for Beat Saber as away for people to request songs that the streamer can device to skip if they so wanted.
Has some advanced features like Inactive Queue that "saves" peoples requests if they leave chat moving those who stick around ahead in the list and the perosn who left doesn't miss their request!
